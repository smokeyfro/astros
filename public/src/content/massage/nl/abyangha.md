Characteristic of the Abyangha, a total body massage, is the use of warm oil containing various therapeutic medicinal herbs. This brings the body and mind to rest and deep relaxation, eliminates disturbances and activates the metabolism so that waste products are discharged through the body faster and more efficiently. 

A distinction is made within our massage between relaxation massage and therapeutic massage. Relaxation massage prevents disturbances in the body. Regular massage is highly recommended within the Ayurvedic tradition. Therapeutic massage positively influences disruptions that have occurred. You can think of:

- stress-related complaints such as burnout, overtiredness, neck and/or shoulder problems
- Rheumatism-related complaints such as arthritis, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, gout, joint problems
- skin-related complaints such as acne, psoriasis, eczema, mold, dryness, itching 
- general pain complaints
- airways such as COPD, asthma, bronchitis, colds
- injuries and/or help with rehabilitation processes such as fractures, tears and bruises
- headaches, migraines as well as scalp-related complaints such as flaking, dryness, dandruff or itching
- muscle disorders such as muscle weakness, degenerative complaints, muscle pain
- various complaints such as depression, back pain, ME or chronic fatigue syndrome, Parkinson's disease.
